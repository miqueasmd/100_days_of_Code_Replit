   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Add necessary paths and configurations

4. Run the Python scripts using your preferred Python interpreter.

5. For the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   - Access the application in your web browser at `http://127.0.0.1:81` (5000, or the port you specified).

## Future Updates

We will continue updating this readme file as we complete more challenges and projects.

Stay tuned for more exciting projects and challenges!

## Security Best Practices

1. Store sensitive credentials in environment variables (e.g., `.env` files) and ensure they are secure.
2. Protect your credentials: Never share them or commit sensitive files (e.g., `.env`) to version control.
3. Use strong, regularly updated credentials for enhanced security.
4. Implement HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
5. Regularly update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.
6. Use a web application firewall (WAF) to protect against common web exploits.
7. Limit user permissions by following the principle of least privilege.
8. Regularly monitor logs for suspicious activity or unauthorized access attempts.
