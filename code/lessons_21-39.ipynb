    "\n",
    "Use Day 27's character generator for this project...to build an automated game battle system!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "1. Add return functions to your character's health and strength statuses from Day 27's project.\n",
    "2. Generate two different characters and store their data (health and strength stats, character type, name, etc.).\n",
    "3. Use a `while True` loop to simulate those two characters battling.\n",
    "4. Roll one six-sided dice for both characters. The character who rolls the higher amount wins that round.\n",
    "5. The winner of that round (the one who rolled the higher number) will give damage to the other character by doing the following:\n",
    "   - Find the difference between the strength of both opponents and add one.\n",
    "   - Take that amount away from the loser's health.\n",
    "6. At the end of each round, check the stats of each character to ensure neither of them have died yet.\n",
    "7. When one character dies (they run out of health), declare a winner of the battle!\n",
    "8. To keep this battle from looking hideous between rounds use `time.sleep` to pause between rounds and `os.system(\"clear\")` to ensure the screen clears between battles.\n",
    "9. Extra points for the use of emojis, colors, or even sound code!\n",

    "3. Tweak the `while` loop from Day 27 to introduce the first character and their stats followed by the character they will battle and that character's stats. (You will want to include pausing and clearing of the code as you did on Day 27).\n",
    "4. Create a counter (within the loop) to keep track of the winner for each round.\n",
    "5. Create another `while` loop inside the current `while` loop with `if` statements, pausing, and clearing of code to show what happens if character 1 wins, the characters tie, etc.\n",
    "6. Make sure you give a recap of the health each character has left after each round."

    "1. Check if a letter is in the string: ```if inputLetter in string```.\n",
    "2. Try using underscores to show blanks to let the user know how many more letters there are to guess.\n",
    "3. Keep track of letters used. Try adding each letter chosen to a new list, then checking this list for each subsequent choice.\n",
    "4. Check out our [100 Days of Code forum](https://replit.com/community-hub) for help.\n"
