    "Today's challenge is to create a contact card using a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. Ask the user to input their name, date of birth, telephone number, email, and physical address.\n",
    "2. Store it all in a dictionary.\n",
    "3. Print it out in a nice way once it's stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "🌟 **Contact Card** 🌟\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Input your name > David Morgan\n",
    "\n",

    "or write to The Cupboard Under The Stairs, Replit Towers, NY.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hints:\n",
    "1. You may find ```\"\"\"``` helpful here.\n",
    "2. Don't forget to ```.strip()``` out any unwanted spaces.\n",
    "3. Pay close attention to when to use ```[]``` and when to use ```{}```.\n",
    "4. For extra fun, try [investigating the](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries_add.asp) ```.update()``` [method](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries_add.asp) for another way of working with dictionaries.\n"

    "   - **Air** is white\n",
    "   - **Earth** is green  \n",
    "   *(You decide on the other.)*\n",

    "### Task:\n",
    "Your system should:\n",
    "1. Have a menu that asks if you want to add, view, move, or edit a 'to do'.\n",
    "2. If you choose 'add', then the system should:\n",
    "   - Prompt you to input what the 'to do' is, when it is due by, and the priority (high, medium, or low).\n",
    "   - Add the 'to do' to the list.\n",
    "3. 'View' should give two options:\n",
    "   - **View all**: Shows all 'to dos' with a pretty print.\n",
    "   - **View priority**: Allows you to search for high, medium, or low priority tasks and only see matching tasks.\n",
    "4. 'Edit' allows you to change any of the information within one of the 'to dos'.\n",
    "5. 'Remove' lets you completely remove a 'to do' when it is 'to done'.\n",

    "Today's challenge is to create a high score table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task:\n",
    "Your program should:\n",
    "1. Ask the user to input their three-letter initials and score (out of about 100,000).\n",
    "2. Save both those values into a file called `high.score`.\n",
    "3. This should use append mode. If the file doesn't exist, it should be created. If it does, the score should be added to the end.\n",
    "4. Each new entry score should go on a new line as `initials score`. Then start a new line for the next entry.\n",
    "5. Add 2–3 scores for testing in a loop.\n",
    "6. The loop should ask the user if they've finished entering data and stop if they have.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extra Points:\n",
    "- Getting all the inputs with just one `input` command and the `split` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "🌟 **HIGH SCORE TABLE** 🌟\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Input your initials > DJM  \n",
    "Input your score > 89,764  \n",
    "\n",
    "Added to high score table.  \n",
    "Add another? y/n > y  \n",
    "\n",
    "Input your initials > ACY  \n",
    "Input your score > 5,731  \n",
    "\n",
    "Added to high score table.  \n",
    "Add another? y/n > n  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Not much here that you can't get from the examples.\n",
    "2. Don't forget to put a new line character at the end of each write command."

    "You're going to write a program that checks a string to see if it is a palindrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, we **know** that Python has the built-in function `string.reverse()` that you could use.\n",
    "\n",

    "- string slicing\n",
    "- looping\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task:\n",
    "Your program should:\n",
    "1. Prompt the user to input a word.\n",
    "2. Analyze the word to see if it is a palindrome.\n",
    "3. Output a relevant yes/no message.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "🌟 **Palindrome Checker** 🌟\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Input a word > Racecar\n",
    "\n",
    "Racecar is a palindrome. Yay!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hints:\n",
    "This is a tough one, so I've given you some hints about the algorithmic thinking needed for a problem like this:\n",
    "1. Don't forget to standardize the case on input.\n",
    "2. Think about which characters in a word are compared first. Check if they are the same.\n",
    "3. If they've been compared and are the same, remove them and repeat the process with the shorter string.\n",
    "4. Keep going until you're down to a string of length 1 or 0 (depending on whether the original word had an odd/even number of characters. If you get to this point, then you've got a palindrome."
